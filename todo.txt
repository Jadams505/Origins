Concept, sprite & implementation:
	Defiled mimic drops
		Dart weapon could be shotgun, given the vanilla evil biome mimics both have dart versions of the orb/heart guns

Sprite & implementation:
	Defiled axe (the evil biome axes are barely used for their respective trees, and are usually either crafted to improve the speed at which the user can mine regular trees or for use as weapons)
	Maybe defiled yoyo and/or flail

Just implementation:
	
	
Implemented with placeholder sprite:
	Low Signal (implementation not yet polished)
