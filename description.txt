Terraria Origins is a content mod that adds new ways of playing Terraria with content designed and balanced around the vanilla game.

Origins is currently in its early release/Beta version, but still offers 740+ items, 71 enemies, 168 tiles and 6 cool biomes: meaning, there's already a ton of variety already present in the mod! Additionally, there is a new explosive-themed Demolitionist class that can be played up to post-Moon Lord and is balanced well with the other classes.

Origins' content adds alternatives for almost every crevice of gameplay reinforced by its two new and nearly completed world evils: the Defiled and the Riven. It will be impossible not to find something new and fun in Origins, even in its current Beta state.

This mod does not include the music tracks composed for each of the biomes and bosses, and can be found with the music mod here: https://github.com/Tyfyter/OriginsMusic

Origins' wiki is currently in development so Origins' players have a sense of direction. It is not finished, but we are hard at work making it work. The link can be found below:
