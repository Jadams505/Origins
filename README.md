# Origins
A Terraria mod mainly based around adding onto the story of Terraria.
Other gimmicks with the mod include Master Mode accessory drops, alternative content to vanilla options, 
a Demolitionist class balanced with other classes and an art style that fits as close as possible to vanilla.

This mod is a collaboration between Tyfyter2002 and chrersis since April of 2017.
